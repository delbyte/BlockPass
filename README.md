# BlockPass
BlockPass is a decentralized event ticketing platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). By minting each ticket as an onâ€‘chain token and leveraging transparent smart contracts, BlockPass eliminates fraud, scalping, and hidden fees, ensuring every sale, transfer, and redemption is publicly auditable.
